MASTER ULTRAMARINE RECIPE


- Airbrush Molotow Black 180ml Refill bottle (prime)
- Airbrush Liquitex White (zenthil)

- Brush on Ammo Enamel Black Wash (Heavy)
- Remove with Make up sponges

- Airbrush Citadel Talassar Blue
- Airbrush Liquitex Turquoise Deep from BELOW*

- Airbrush Liquitex White above	(correction step)
- Airbrush Talassar Blue above	(correction step)

- Sponge Vallejo Panzer Aces Dark Rust	(chipping)

- Brush Vallejo 70.950 Black all weapons and armour rubber, metals - Black the eye sockets and lens
- Brush Citadel Rhinox Hide all gold and leathers - try to be as neat as possible for all the gold parts, this will sell the gold effect later and remove the need for washes.

- Brush Kimera Red (Mephiston Red is fine) on any Jewels, Wax, Fancy Leather, 70% of the lens
- Brush Vallejo Game Color 72.001 Deadwhite on any Plasma coils, Knee pads, bone and parchment > Wash bones/parchment with Citadel Skeleton Horde
- Brush Citadel Rakaflesh on any Tabards > Wash this with Citadel Seraphim wash

- Cut and Soak the Transfers in water
- Apply Micro set on the armour surface and all the required decals (you can use a cotton bud to apply pressure or a paint brush to soak up excess liquid and move the transfer in position)
- Apply Micro sol 30 seconds later with the same brush (when you apply this, don't touch the decals afterwards with a brush or cotton buds if possible. It'll crimble and crease while the magic works and bonds to curves and irregular surfaces but will dry flat)

- Give that 24 hours to dry

- Airbrush/brush Lucky Matte Varnish or AK Ultra Matte (This isn't an optional step in my honest opinion. I have used very strong inks and oils to set up the armour. Without this step the armour will not be the perfectly crisp blue you'll adore)

You do not need an Airbrush for these Varnishes, they won't ruin the paint or the models and you can be heavy handed. Just treat it like a all over citadel wash and pick up any excess pooling with a brush. I target brush on varnish all the time, airbrush is just much faster.

- Give that 24 hours to dry

- Brush Two Thin Coats Dragon's gold on all the upward facing brown gold (You are treating all the Rhinox hide layers as the shadows, so only hit 90% of the surface area and you'll not need a wash or any additional steps for a cleaner gold) Can easily correct with Rhinox hide.

Use the completed Hellblaster as an example of the gold. Some edges are fully Dragon's Gold. Other parts are left Rhinox hide.

- Brush Vallejo 71.072 Fusil Silver on all the Silvers > wash this with Nuln Oil. Simple, effective and a very smooth metal paint.

- Highlight Silver with Vallejo Alumino Model Metallic Air and optional* dots of Molotow Liquid Chrome (expensive and hard to use product but super high shine)

- Edge Highlight the blue armour with Vallejo Azul Verde 70.808 Blue-Green (try to be careful at this stage, this isn't the final edge so you can have a thicker band here and there if your brush skill isn't up to it) - You can "highlight" the odd bit of chipping.
- Edge Highlight the blue-green highlights with Vallejo Azul Cielo 70.961 Sky Blue (this is your final highest contrasting blue. Use it only on the sharpest areas and not the entire edge of any area)

At this stage you are homefree. You can part skip or entirely skip the Edge Highlighting. I would try to find a happy medium based on your skill with a brush. I would never highlight everything since the value/reward isn't high enough. Focus on the upper body and knees.

- Finish the Lens	= 75% Citadel Evil Suns Scarlet layer above the base red (Kimera/Mephiston), AK Deep Orange thinner band above that, Deep Orange + White mix at the front. Dot of White above black at the very back.
- Finish the Leather	= Citadel XV-88 scratchs, Steel Legion Drab Scratchs, add white
- Finish Tabards	= Rakaflesh, Rakaflesh + Ivory, add white. Shadows = XV88/Drab/Wash. If its to bright for your taste, just selectively use Agrax/Seraphim or a contrast paint and knock it back in areas or all over.
- Finish Red detailing	= lens scheme + Carroburg Crimson/Rojo red for shadows. You can follow the lens scheme for all/any red, helmets etc. If you want a pop just water down Flesh Tearer contrast or a ink to shade shadows to make the orange parts appear brighter as you go along.

- Plasma		= thin Deadwhite Layer x2, Aethermatic Blue contrast (1 coat, from the bottle, quickly and remove pooling) - Magic = Liquitex White ink / Ammo by Mig Oilbrusher White A.MIG-3501 to run along the bottom - Optional* add thin (2:1 water) Coelia Greenshade on the top for a "darker point"

- Finish bone, seals	= After Skeleton Horde has dried, apply XV-88 & ivory mixes as highlights and darken areas/shadows with a Seraphim wash if to heavily bright - Optional* add a (3:1 water) Skeleton Horde all over to unify
- Blacks		= I find 70.950 Black such a killer product you need not highlight black most of the time but some details require a tickle of grey. In these cases just run a selective grey highlight and one higher contrast grey above that. E.g. Skaven Grey/dawnstone etc

- Skin			= (2:1 water) Cadia Flesh, add watered down Carrogburg Crimson & Coelia Greenshade in creases and mottle the skin. Apply another lay of Cadia flesh here and there, highlight with Kislev Flesh. Reikland Flesh all over to unify. Highlight with Cadia & Kislev then add white to the mix for the final dots on the nose, cheeks, brow etc

Skin is deceptively easy to produce if you work ONLY with wash consistency paints. Providing you start from a zenethil (which I did) - You can just apply homemade runny Cadia, Kislev all on all the surface area. Then add selective thin washes for colour and depth. Unify everything with a flesh wash and then go back to Cadia and kislev using thicker consistency paint to highlight and finish adding white.

- Eyes			= 70.950 black the entire eye socket area. Add two pin pricks of deadwhite on ethier side of each other to give the illusion of a eyeball with a pupil (black layer) and the rest of the black acting as a shadow to frame the eye. If the white dots are to large just black them out and repeat until you have a small eye.

- White 		= You can just use them as provided but if you want more depth. Use Apothcary contrast mixed down alittle with water all over and remove the pooling. Then just do sharp highlights with Deadwhite or use the Mig 3501 Oilbrusher white if you bought it.
If you need a white kneepad or to paint a icon white. Just thin down deadwhite and apply 3-4 coats, thin. Its a pain but it'll be smooth. You can decide to give that depth with Apothcary contrast or not.

- Base rim		= 70.950 black (twice) 
- Last step		= Brush on a Satin varnish or Contrast Medium on the low shine areas e.g. Leather, Wax seal, Lens eye. Brush on AK Ultra Matte/ Lucky Matte on the zero shine areas e.g. Tabards, bone, seals, face etc and importantly the base rims.


Most paints can be traded out for your existing collection. The methods to paint red, leather, tabards etc etc can be tweaked to your own schemes or liking, youtube etc. 

I strongly suggest you heed my advise for the Gold, Silver and Blue Edge highlighting. It'll be much easier and more fun with those products and methods. 

A rough rule, anything where heavy use of contrast, inks and washes are used (faces, tabards etc). Brush on your Matte varnish to kick them in alignment.  

The products I suggest that are mandatory;

1. AK Ultra matte Varnish or Ammo by Mig Ultra-Matt Lucky Varnish - Both are very similar, AK has a slightly stronger finish. I did use Lucky Matt on the Hellblaster because my AK had run out.
2. Ammo A.MIG-3501 Oilbrusher White - You'll want this product if your brush control isn't good. It'll skillessly add the white glow at the bottom on any plasma and completely sell the effect alone. You can remove overspill with White Spirit like an Eraser. If you have the brush skill then you can just use Liquitex White ink for the same strong, runny application but much harder to correct if you go on heavy. Everyone will love your plasma and it'll be as easy as a contrast paint and this secret product. Without ethier you'll need a much more complicated plasma recipe for a worse result.
3. Both Blue Edge Highlight paints by Vallejo - I have done alot of testing so I know these are the best two colours for the post varnished armour finish.
4. Two Thin Coats Dragon Gold - You can 100% use Retributor Armour instead, the colour is 99.99% the same but it just so chunky to use. This is very smooth, fun, easier.
5. Vallejo Fusil Silver - Same as the above, any citadel metal with a nuln oil wash will work but this is a very good colour that is very smooth to use, fun, easier.
6. Micro set & sol - You'll never go back and it is a lifetime purchase. You'll never run out but it'll make all those pesky transfers look "painted on" and importantly curve and conform to tough surfaces like the shoulders and knees.
7. Vallejo 70.950 Black - Unbeatable finish. You can choose to entirely skip highlighting black if you like the look. If you want to highlight black just apply a citadel grey.

Honorable mention;

I use x2 Artus Opus Series S size 2 brushes to paint everything and have x2 size 0 that I barely use to keep its point for longer for specific tasks. If you look after your s2, this brush will have a point for detail work but it is nice to split the task up and keep the size 0 point ready.

The reason I have duplicates of each is one is for metals and the other for Acrylic. This is to avoid my main brush getting metal flakes and such, makes things faster and easier to look after. Just make sure you use different water with your metal brushes too.

I find good tools and equipment can make the much harder jobs a breeze so it felt worthwhile mentioning it. I personally hate painting metals and Two Thin Coats Dragon Gold with a Opus Size 2 is like butter smooth work, easy. Worth it.
